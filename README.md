# PROBLEMS
## BUILD FAILURE

when you try to load caman like the following,

```index.js
import Caman from 'caman';
```

an error occurs.

```
error  in ./node_modules/canvas/build/Release/canvas.node

Module parse failed: Unexpected character 'ï¿½' (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
(Source code omitted for this binary file)

 @ ./node_modules/canvas/lib/bindings.js 3:17-56
 @ ./node_modules/canvas/lib/canvas.js
 @ ./node_modules/caman/dist/caman.full.js
 @ ./src/router/index.js
 @ ./src/main.js
 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080 webpack/hot/dev-server ./src/main.js
```

To avoid this error, read caman lib by `<script>` tag.
